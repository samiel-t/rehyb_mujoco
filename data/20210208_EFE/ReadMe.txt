These bench tests were conducted to provide information signals for TUM, for ReHyb Project. Different tests have been carried out in accordance to their requests

The mass used in some tests was attached at ~21.5cm from the center of rotation of EFE along the slider

20210208_EFE_PositionRamp1 : Ramp trajectory [0-60]° on EFE, with with a mass of 0.5kg attached
20210208_EFE_PositionRamp2 : Ramp position [0-20]° on EFE, with a mass of 0.5kg attached, SFE position controlled at -90°
20210208_EFE_StaticTorque1 : EFE is in 0° position, with a mass of 0.5kg attached, Torque controlled (0 torque)
20210208_EFE_StaticTorque2 : EFE is in 20° position controlled, with a mass of 0.5kg attached
20210208_EFE_StaticTorque3 : EFE is in 45° position controlled, with a mass of 0.5kg attached
